  - tweak: Additional support has been instated for templates which are to be loaded
      multiple times. The main user-facing change is that when adding shuttle-restricted
      waypoints to an overmap object's initial_restricted_waypoints list, use the
      shuttle's type path, not its name. Templates that load ferry-type shuttles with
      waypoints not on the template will break with this system, but you can opt out
      by setting modify_tag_vars on the template datum to FALSE.
